## Use in Modpacks

You can use this mod in modpacks under the following conditions:
- If the modpack does not cost money or the like (donations are fine of course).
- When you give credits to the contributors (e.g. a [link](/graphs/contributors) somewhere in the modpacks description or list of mods).
- When the mod is not downloaded from the official repository directly to the players machine you have to inform the players on the modpack page about it.
  A general mention (without naming this mod explicitly) is enough.<br />
  _Downloading code or programs from official sources directly to the end user's computer makes it more difficult for manipulated code to spread, thus increasing security - you wouldn't want to download Microsoft Windows from a questionable .to website, would you?_


## Contributing

First of all, any kind of contribution is welcome. However, there are two small guidelines:

This mod is intended to add plants as freely configurable as possible. No more, no less.
Features that other mods cover better, these mods should take care of.
To give an example; To ensure that only the owner can harvest the plant, you should use a mod that allows players to claim a chunk.

Before making a pull request, please document your code - Don't overdo it but add at least some javadoc comments.
It can be a pain to read undocumented code from other people. In the worst case, historically grown code. \*cough\* Forge &lt; 1.16 \*cough\*
