- `_file.format`: The format of this file. ALWAYS 0!
- `_file.version`: The version of this file/ plant. Choose what you want, this value isn't used at the moment.

## Specific Plant Types
```json5
{
  // ...
  "type": {
    "can_use_bonemeal": "<boolean>" // Crops, Overlays, Extendables, Saplings
  }
}
```
}


## Datatypes

### Datatypes (Common)

#### `<object/AABB>`
_AxisAlignedBoundingBox_

```json
{
  "x1": "<double>",
  "x2": "<double>",
  "y1": "<double>",
  "y2": "<double>",
  "z1": "<double>",
  "z2": "<double>"
}
```
The coordinates of the corners of the cuboid bounding box ('hit box').


#### `<string/ResourceLocation>`

A resource location is similar to the stuff you enter in commands (except the meta data):
`/give @p <mod_id>:<item_id> <amount> <nbt>`
```json5
"<item_id>"                 // partly defined, use defaults: customplants:<item_id>:0
"<item_id>:<nbt>"           // partly defined, use defaults: customplants:<item_id>:<nbt>
"<mod_id>:<item_id>"        // partly defined, use defaults: <mod_id>:<item_id>:0
"<mod_id>:<item_id>:<nbt>"  // fully defined
```


#### `<object/Drop>`
```json5
{
  "rounds": "<int[0~5]>",  // Default 0
  "count": "<int[0~]",     // Default 1
  "item": "<string/ResourceLocation>"
}
```
- `rounds`: The maximum attempts to drop the item. Use 0 for 100% drop.
- `count`: The amount of items to be dropped.
- `item`: The item to be dropped.

The method to determine whether an item should be dropped:
```java
// TODO: 06.06.22 find a better implementation for random drops
protected boolean doDrop(Random rand, int fortune, float rounds) {
        if (rounds == 0) return true;
        int success = (fortune + 2) / 2;
        for (int i = 0; i < rounds; i++) {
            if (rand.nextInt(fortune + 2) / 2 > success) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
```


#### `<object/Behavior>`

```json
{
  "actions": "<object/Events>",
  "features": "<object/Features>"
}
```
The features/ actions are only executed if the position of this object in the array matches the age of the plant.


#### `<object/Effect>`

```json5
{
  "id": "<int>",                  // Required
  "duration": "<int[0~1000000]>", // Default 30 (= 1s)
  "amplifier": "<int[0~255]>",    // Default 0
  "ambient": "<boolean>",         // Default 0
  "particles": "<boolean>"        // Default true
}
```
- When using a mod's effect ID, make sure to require the mod in the packs `pack.mcmeta` file!
- Duration is in game ticks
- When the effect is added by a feature, the value should be `true`, otherwise `false` to not confuse players.<br />
  When true, a blue border is drawn around the effect card left to the inventory.
  This indicates, that the effect came from a beacon and plants with features are just like beacons, I guess.
- When the effect is added by an action, the value should be `false` to indicate that this effect will be gone after the time run out.


### Datatypes (Actions)


#### `<object/Events>`

```json
{
  "clicked": "<object/Action>",
  "collided_entity": "<object/Actions>",
  "collided_npc":" <object/Actions>",
  "collided_player": "<object/Actions>",
  "destroyed": "<object/Actions>",
  "grown": "<object/Actions>"
}
```
- `clicked`: When the plant gets (de)activated by right-clicking.
- `collided_entity`: When any entity (Players, NPCs, Items, ...) collides with the plant.
- `collided_npc`: When an NPC (village, pig, cow, ...) collides with the plant.
- `collided_player`: When a player collides with the plant.
- `destroyed`: When the plant gets destroyed.
- `grown`: When the plant grows.<br />
  Will be ignored if the plant doesn't grow. 


#### `<object/Actions>`

```json5
{
  "air": "<int[-300~300]>",               // Default 0
  "effects": "<array<object/Effect>>",    // Default []
  "experience_amount": "<int>",           // Default 0
  "experience_is_in_levels": "<boolean>", // Default false
  "health_amount": "<float>",             // Default 0
  "hunger_amount": "<int[-20~20]>",       // Default 0
  "hunger_exhaustion": "<int>",           // Default 0  TODO 2022-06-04
  "hunger_saturation": "<int>",           // Default 0  TODO 2022-06-04
  "target": "<string/TargetSelector>"     // Required
}
```
- `air`: The amount air to add/ remove to/ from the target (Every entity).
- `effects`: Effects to add to the target (Living entities; NPC, Player).
- `experience_amount`: Experience to add to the target.
- `experience_is_in_levels`: Whether `experience_amount` is in XP or levels.
- `health_amount`: Amount of health to add to the target.
- `hunger_amount`:  Amount of hunger (the meat clubs) to add to the target.
- `hunger_exhaustion`: Invisible value; Amount of exhaustion to add to the target.
- `hunger_saturation`: Invisible value; Amount of saturation to add to the target.
- `target`: The target (`@<a|e|p|s>`, player name, anything. Like in Commands).


### Datatypes (Features)


#### `<object/Features>`

```json5
{
  "can_sustain_leaves": "<boolean>",                                          // Default false
  "effects": "<array<array/tuple<<string/TargetSelector>,<object/Effect>>>",  // Default []
  "enchant_power_bonus": "<float>",                                           // Default 0
  "is_ladder": "<boolean>",                                                   // Default false
  "is_solid": "<boolean>",                                                    // Default false
  "is_web": "<boolean>"                                                       // Default false
}
```
- `can_sustain_leaves`: **\[WIP\]** I have literally NO idea, what this does. I expected this prevents leaves from decaying but this happens absolutely random. I have no idea. May get removed.
- `effects`: Effects to add to their targets.
- `enchant_power_bonus`: Lets the plant act as a bookshelf for enchantment tables.<br />
  Bookshelves have a bonus of `1.0`.
- `is_ladder`: Lets the plant act as a ladder.
- `is_solid`: Makes the plant solid block (i.e. unpassable).<br />
   Note that `is_ladder` and `is_web` won't work anymore.
- `is_web`: Lets the plant act as a spider web.

Note that feature values defined in `constant` will get overridden when a value is defined in the other states `active` and `inactive`.
